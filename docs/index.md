# The Journey From 🩺 to 👨‍💻

Hi! I'm **Hariram**, and my story isn't just about coding—it's about growth, resilience, and turning setbacks into fuel for new beginnings. Let me take you through the journey of how I arrived at where I am today:

---

## 📖 The Beginning of a Story
Born on a warm summer day, **July 19, 2001**, in the quiet town of **Tirunelveli**, life began in a place where dreams and aspirations would mix with the challenges of reality. Raised in a lower-middle-class family, I learned early on the value of hard work, persistence, and family. My mother, a pillar of the household, and my father, a dedicated supervisor in the TASMAC, taught me that every role in life is vital and meaningful, no matter how small it may seem.

---

## 🚶‍♂️ The Only Child's Path
As the only child in the family, I was both the recipient of immense love and the subject of strict rules—each step carefully guided, each decision influenced by a desire to shape me into someone who could stand strong in the face of life's challenges. The lessons were tough but loving, and they formed the foundation of who I am today.

---

## 🩺 A Dream That Never Faded
Like many, I once held a dream that seemed to fit the classic mold—becoming a doctor. The idea of wearing a white coat and helping others in their time of need was a dream that I carried in my heart for years. But life, as it often does, has a way of redirecting our paths, no matter how strong our dreams may be.

---

## 📚 The Early Struggles
In the classroom, I was a known face during my early years. I thrived in the world of books and numbers. But as I reached the stage where dreams began to compete with reality, the challenges grew more complex. In **HSC**, the performance didn’t reflect my earlier success. Then came the **NEET exam**, and despite my best efforts, it felt like running a race with hurdles that seemed insurmountable. I failed, but it wasn’t the end.

---

## 🔄 A Second Chance
NEET was a door I couldn’t quite open, but my parents, always my greatest support, gave me another opportunity. For two years, I tried again, each attempt bringing me closer to a solution that felt out of reach. But in the end, I realized that the merit seat I dreamed of in Tamil Nadu wasn’t meant for me.

---

## 🚀 A New Direction
With one door closed, I turned to another, applying for **Engineering College counseling**. The universe had other plans for me, and I found myself in **NEC, Kovilpatti**, a place where I would begin to write a new chapter in my life. It was not the path I had envisioned, but sometimes, the detours are where we find what we were truly meant to do.

---

## 💡 The First Glimpse of a New Passion
In this new environment, I found myself staring at a world I had never considered—**computers**. It was like learning a new language, one that spoke of logic, algorithms, and the power of creation. The pressure of failure still lingered, a reminder of the dreams I hadn’t realized, but I embraced it with a mix of blame and courage. Failing for three years didn’t break me—it forged me.

---

## 🔄 Continual Learning
And so, here I am today. Still learning. Still growing. With every line of code, every challenge faced, and every new concept I uncover, I continue this journey of transformation. The story isn’t over yet; in fact, it’s just getting started.
